Everything we see, hear and feel is just an echo from the past. But this illusion has influenced us and the way we view the world in so many ways; from Newton's physics with a linearly progressing timeline accruing absolute knowledge along the way to the von Neumann machine with its total ordering of instructions updating mutable state with full control of the \"present\". But unfortunately this is not how the world works. There is no present, all we have is facts derived from the merging of multiple pasts. The truth is closer to Einstein's physics where everything is relative to one's perspective.  \n\n\t As developers we need to wake up and break free from the perceived reality of living in a single globally consistent present. The advent of multicore and cloud computing architectures meant that most applications today are distributed systems--multiple cores separated by the memory bus or multiple nodes separated by the network--which puts a harsh end to this illusion. Facts travel at the speed of light (at best), which makes the distinction between past and perceived present even more apparent in a distributed system where latency is higher and where facts (messages) can get lost.  \n\n\t The only way to design truly scalable and performant systems that can construct a sufficiently consistent view of history--and thereby our local \"present\"--is by treating time as a first class construct in our programming model and to model the present as facts derived from the merging of multiple concurrent pasts.  \n\n\t In this talk we will explore what all this means to the design of our systems, how we need to view and model consistency, consensus, communication, history and behaviour, and look at some practical tools and techniques to bring it all together.","type":2,"startTime":"2015-03-17T18:35:00Z","endTime":"2015-03-17T18:35:00Z","date":"TUESDAY MARCH 17","track":{"id":1043,"host":"","description":"","name":"Track 1-Intermediate Tuesday","shortdescription":""},"location":{"id":589,"name":"Herbst Pavilion","mapUrl":"http:\/\/scala-days-2015.s3.amazonaws.com\/locationsMap.png"},"speakers":[{"id":4881,"picture":"http:\/\/event.scaladays.org\/dl\/photos\/Scala%20Days%202015%20speakers\/Jonas%20Boner.PNG","name":"Jonas Bon\u00e9r","title":"","company":"Co-founder and CTO at Typesafe","twitter":"@jboner","bio":"Jonas is the co-founder and CTO of Typesafe building a platform for Reactive Systems--implementing the principles of the Reactive Manifesto, a manifesto that Jonas initiated and co-authored."}]},{"id":6543,"title":"Quantifind's story: Building custom interactive data analytics infrastructure","description":"Building interactive data analytics products on top of large volumes of data is challenging.

A type system is a theorem prover, and types are capable of much more. When they are used to express invariants, the type system can prove these hold and show where they do not. Tests prove your code is correct for some values, types can prove your code is correct for all values.  \n\n\t This talk is aimed at Scala developers with a background in object oriented programming who want to learn new ways to use types to improve the correctness of their code. It introduces the topic in a practical fashion, concentrating on the \"easy wins\" developers can apply to their code today.  \n\n\t We will look at how invariants and preconditions are traditionally expressed with assertions and the runtime errors they produce. We examine how some of these are solved with types in the standard library and elsewhere and the guarantees they provide. Then we show how common invariants can be expressed with custom data types and how these use compiler errors to prevent bugs. This will touch on tagged types, typesafe wrappers, algebraic data types and path dependent types.  \n\n\t Finally the talk demonstrates there is a whole world of types outside of object oriented design and hopes to encourage you to spend the time to discover these for yourself.","type":2,"startTime":"2015-03-17T22:40:00Z","endTime":"2015-03-17T22:40:00Z","date":"TUESDAY MARCH 17","track":{"id":1045,"host":"","description":"","name":"Track 3 - Beginner Tuesday","shortdescription":""},"location":{"id":591,"name":"Golden Gate Room","mapUrl":"http:\/\/scala-days-2015.s3.amazonaws.com\/locationsMap.png"},"speakers":[{"id":4898,"picture":"http:\/\/event.scaladays.org\/dl\/photos\/Scala%20Days%202015%20speakers\/Iain%20Hull.PNG","name":"Iain Hull","title":"","company":"Software Engineer at Workday","twitter":"@IainHull","bio":"Iain is a software engineer at Workday using Scala and Akka to deliver their next generation elastic grid.

The challenge is that most REST API backends can't quickly scale to the numbers of requests needed in a modern enterprise. In this talk, we will introduce enterprise developers to Akka in an engaging and simple way and give them the confidence that they could quickly and easily build an enterprise web service that scales in their own workplace. This live coding session will showcase Akka's power by taking an existing REST API and improving its throughput drastically by introducing a distributed actor system. Starting from a simple RESTful application exposing read and write operations, we'll introduce a series of Akka features and patterns, scaling the performance and reliability of the system progressively.  \n\n\t We will introduce the Actor pattern, and show how Akka brings this pattern easily and simply to the JVM. A simple actor system will separate concerns and serve as the basis of the exercise. Clustering will allow the system to grow and shrink dynamically, across one or more machines, with messages being passed transparently between nodes as needed. CQRS (Command-Query Response Separation) will decouple writes from reads and introduce non-blocking message handling, and Akka Persistence will make nodes tolerant to failure and avoid data loss.  \n\n\t We'll show how simple decoupling via message-passing of the system components allows you to scale each part of your service to match changing load.  \n\n\t If you need more write performance, you can increase the number of nodes handling writes. Need more REST-API capability, increase the nodes binding to HTTP. Each element is independently elastic for full tuneability.  \n\n\t Throughout the process, we'll use Gatling to gauge our results in the form of handled requests per second.

Built on top of shapeless's core generic programming primitives it allows instances for a wide variety of useful type classes to be derived for Scala ADTs with no (or at most minimal) boilerplate.  \n\n\t But until recently the types it could derive for (families of Scala case classes sharing a common sealed trait and with fairly minimal support for recursion) was quite limited. In shapeless 2.1.0 its scope has been significantly expanded to include non-case classes (so long as they are sufficiently \"case class-like\") and more complex recursion patterns (eg. through types outside the immediate family). It now also allows for the provision of specialized, non-derived, instances for specific case class members of the families being derived for.  \n\n\t This means that TypeClass is now the tool of choice for many important generic programming problems in Scala.  \n\n\t In this talk I will demonstrate this with example derivations of ordering and type-safe equality type classes, serialization and deserialization and a variety of other folds, unfolds and transformations which would otherwise require huge amounts of tedious boilerplate to implement.","type":2,"startTime":"2015-03-18T17:25:00Z","endTime":"2015-03-18T17:25:00Z","date":"WEDNESDAY MARCH 18","track":{"id":1050,"host":"","description":"","name":"Track 4 - Advanced Wednesday","shortdescription":""},"location":{"id":592,"name":"Southside Theater","mapUrl":"http:\/\/scala-days-2015.s3.amazonaws.com\/locationsMap.png"},"speakers":[{"id":4910,"picture":"http:\/\/event.scaladays.org\/dl\/photos\/Scala%20Days%202015%20speakers\/Miles%20Sabin.PNG","name":"Miles Sabin","title":"","company":"Chuusai Ltd.","twitter":"@milessabin","bio":"Miles has been doing stuff with Scala for the last ten years, most recently with _.underscore and Precog.

Suppose you want to extract some key information--maybe a little, maybe as much as you can.

If there is an error, you'd like to know something about what or where it was. What should you do?  \n\n\t You could try using primitives like String.split and .toInt, but they're fragile, don't pass back detailed information, and are incredibly slow in the face of numerous minor (recoverable) errors. Regex matching gives more flexibility in specifying what you want, but recursion is awkward and again, information about errors is hard to come by.  \n\n\t You could encode all possibilities for failure into your types, including how to pass back the relevant information about errors, but then you spend most of your effort thinking about every which way something can go wrong, and more effort handling the error cases than the successes, when you really want to think about success.  \n\n\t Grok provides an alternative by doing everything wrong: it is mutable, low-level, and has non-local return flow (via stackless exceptions).

These resources can then be used by all applications in the cluster, very similar to a threadpool on a local machine.

Scoping database sessions correctly and configuring a connection pool in an efficient way were already non-trivial in blocking JEE-style applications, but if you try to fit the inherently blocking JDBC API into a Play or Akka app, it gets even harder. In the newest version of Slick, Typesafe's database library, we provide a different way of sequencing database actions, based on the ideas of Haskell's IO monad. This talk will show you how to use this new API to safely compose and execute database calls, returning Futures and Reactive Streams from them. Bridging the gap between the blocking JDBC API and your non-blocking applications also requires a very different threading model and connection pool configuration than in a blocking app. You will learn what Slick does behind the scenes to take care of these issues in order to give you good scalability and performance out of the box.","type":2,"startTime":"2015-03-18T23:50:00Z","endTime":"2015-03-18T23:50:00Z","date":"WEDNESDAY MARCH 18","track":{"id":1045,"host":"","description":"","name":"Track 3 - Beginner Tuesday","shortdescription":""},"location":{"id":591,"name":"Golden Gate Room","mapUrl":"http:\/\/scala-days-2015.s3.amazonaws.com\/locationsMap.png"},"speakers":[{"id":4902,"picture":"http:\/\/event.scaladays.org\/dl\/photos\/Scala%20Days%202015%20speakers\/Stefan%20Zieger.PNG","name":"Stefan Zieger","title":"","company":"Typesafe","twitter":"@StefanZeiger","bio":"Stefan Zeiger is the tech lead for Slick.
